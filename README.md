# PhotoMapper

Photo Mapper was a project I used to gain experience in creating a custom UI for view photos, as well as incorporating the camera and adding new photos to the users photo gallery.

Also added a view for a map overlay that would add pin drops based on the geo location of where the photo was taken.
